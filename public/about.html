    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="../assets/images/Eu.jpg" alt="Foto de Christian Reis" height="200">
    <p> Hi! I'm Christian Reis, a Systems Analysis and Development student with a strong passion for technology and creativity. I'm currently focused on building a career in web development, with a particular interest in the front-end side — where design meets functionality.
    </p>

    <p>I'm actively learning through online courses and YouTube tutorials, always looking for practical ways to apply what I learn. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. I'm especially drawn to the visual and interactive aspects of development, and I'm constantly experimenting to improve my skills.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, music plays a huge role in my life — it keeps me focused, inspired, and motivated every day. I'm currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute, grow as a developer, and gain real-world experience in a collaborative environment.</p>
