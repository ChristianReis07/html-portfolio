        <h1>The Best Movies According to Christian Reis</h1>
        <h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
        <hr />

        <h3>The Godfather - 1972</h3>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/"><img src="../assets/images/Godfather.jpg" alt="Godfather movie cover" height="200"></a>
        <p>I love everything about this movie, from how the story unfolds to the cinematography, which by the way is quite old but still manages to captivate many people, even those from my generation who were born from 1995 onwards.</p>
        
        <h3>V for Vendetta - 2005</h3>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/"><img src="../assets/images/V.jpg" alt="V for Vendetta movie cover" height="200"></a>
        <p>I have a great affection for this movie because I watched it when I was a teenager, and what captivated me when I was young were the action scenes and the plot with mysteries. Then, as an adult, after watching the movie again, I realized that this film conveys very deep messages and ideas to reflect on our society.</p>
        
        <h3>About Time - 2013</h3>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/"><img src="../assets/images/AboutTime.jpg" alt="About Time movie cover" height="200"></a>
        <p>About Time is a movie that one night, when I was bored, I ended up choosing to watch, and I fell in love with how the film tells the protagonist's life story. The movie delivers many great messages to carry throughout life and teaches how to treat the people around you.</p>
